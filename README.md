### Customization Notes:
- Replace `[Your Name]`, `[Your Age]`, `yourusername`, etc., with your details.
- Update the "Hot Projects" section with your real projects, linking to their repos and specifying the tech used (e.g., "React + Tailwind" or "C# + SQL").
- Swap `[Your Favorite IDE]` for something like "VS Code" or "IntelliJ".
- Tweak the tone or add more languages if you want (e.g., TypeScript, PHP).

This version leans hard into the programming theme with code snippets in multiple languages (Bash, Python, C#) and a focus on your specified stack. Want more terminal vibes or a specific project highlighted? Let me know!
